# OAT Configurator
This is the source code for a small React-based app, using AntDesign that asks the user a bunch of questions about what components
they used to build their tracker and then spits out the defines that need to be placed in configuration_local.hpp.

It can be used live at https://config.openastrotech.com

# Status
Captures the great majority of use cases for the OAT. Please file Issues if you would like to see more variables supported, or if you are 
able, please create and submit a PR with an extra step in the code. It's pretty easy to add a new stpe to the Wizard, just look at the
stepProps array in WizardSteps.jsx and add a new array item there. 

# Roadmap
- Bluetooth - not currently queried.
- Dark mode support.
